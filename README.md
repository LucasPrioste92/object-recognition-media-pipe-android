# Object Recognition with MediaPipe
This project is a simple implementation of object recognition using MediaPipe to load and run the
efficientdet_lite0 model.
It accesses the device’s camera, processes each frame in real-time, and performs inference to detect
objects—drawing bounding boxes and labels directly
on the image.<br/>
The project follows a Clean Architecture approach for better separation of concerns and
maintainability.
